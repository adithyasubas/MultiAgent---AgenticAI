# AI Marketing Lab Highlights

We unified CRM notes, chat transcripts, and campaign metrics in a governed feature store that feeds retrieval-augmented prompts. Reps now launch an enablement app inside Salesforce to generate persona-specific discovery questions and objection handling scripts, cutting follow-up time to six hours.

A headline evaluation harness scores clarity, differentiation, and compliance before humans review, doubling the number of campaign variants released each sprint while keeping legal in the loop. Every asset is watermarked for audit readiness.

Across three pilot industries, AI-assisted webinar promotions lifted click-throughs by 41% in manufacturing, 19% in healthcare, and 8% in fintech. Guardrails include retrieval grounding, automated evaluations, and human approvals within four hours. Download the governance checklist and prompt library shared with attendees, and book a strategy call to plan your rollout.
