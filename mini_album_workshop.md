# Build A Mini Accordion Album

Cut two 4x12 inch cardstock strips, score them every three inches, and tape the ends to form a six-panel accordion base. Trim patterned inserts slightly smaller than four inches so a clean border frames each page.

Alternate bold Garden Party prints with solids, then mat 3x3 photos on coordinating cardstock. Add flip tabs on panels two and four with washi to hide journaling. Vellum pockets keep extra notes ready for gift recipients.

Layer die-cut florals with thin foam to maintain a flat fold, sprinkle chipboard sentiments, and wrap a cardstock belly band around the finished album with a mini magnet closure. Ink edges with coral distress ink and title the project with puffy alphas. Share yours with #MiniAlbumMonday.
