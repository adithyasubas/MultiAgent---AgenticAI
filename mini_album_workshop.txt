Hey makers, welcome to the mini album workshop. In this session I'm guiding you through a six-panel accordion album that you can craft in under an hour. Start by cutting two pieces of heavyweight cardstock to 4x12 inches; score each at the three, six, and nine inch marks so they fold into equal panels. Join the strips with double-sided tape to build a continuous base.

Next we choose patterned papers. I'm working with the Garden Party collection and trimming inserts just shy of four inches to leave a slim border. Adhere with a glue stick and burnish to avoid bubbles. Remember to alternate busy patterns with solids so the eye has a place to rest.

For photos, print three-by-three squares and mat them on coordinating cardstock. I like to offset the mats for movement. Use washi to create flip-up tabs on the second and fourth panels so you can hide journaling beneath the photos. If you're gifting the album, leave spots blank and tuck vellum pockets for recipients to add their own memories.

Let's embellish. Die-cut a handful of florals and layer them with foam squares. Sprinkle chipboard sentiments but keep dimension low so the album folds flat. On the final panel, create a belly band from leftover cardstock and secure with a tiny magnet closure. This keeps the album tidy when stored on a shelf.

To finish, ink the edges with a coral distress ink for cohesion and add a title using puffy alpha stickers. The completed album holds eight photos plus hidden journaling and takes about forty minutes start to finish. Share your variations with hashtag #MiniAlbumMonday and tag the channel so I can feature your work.
