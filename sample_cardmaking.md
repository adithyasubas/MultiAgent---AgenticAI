# Celebrate With Watercolor Layers

If you want a quick handmade birthday card, start by taping cold press paper to your board and washing it with coral, peach, and gold watercolor. Let it dry before adding details.

Once dry, trim navy cardstock for the base, run a stitched frame and confetti accents through your die-cut machine, and splatter metallic paint over the background.

Pop the frame up with foam tape, cluster the confetti around your sentiment, and hand-letter a simple "happy birthday" message in white ink. Finish the design with sequins and mount the panel to a 5x7 card.

Share your finished card on Instagram and tag @StudioCardmaker so we can see what you create.
