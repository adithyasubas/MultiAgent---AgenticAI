Hi everyone, welcome back to the studio. Today I'm walking you through creating a layered birthday card with a watercolor wash background and hand-lettered sentiment.

First I tape my cold press paper onto a board and drop in a gradient of coral, peach, and gold. While that dries I trim a piece of navy cardstock. Next I bring in the die-cutting machine to make a stitched frame and some confetti accents.

Once the background is dry I splatter metallic paint, then adhere the frame using foam tape for dimension. I layer the confetti pieces around the sentiment area and finish with a brush-lettered "happy birthday" in white ink. Don't forget to let everything dry before you add the final embellishments.

For finishing touches I add sequins, mount the panel on the navy cardstock, and attach it to a 5x7 card base. The contrast makes the colors glow. If you recreate this card tag me on Instagram at @StudioCardmaker. Thanks for crafting with me!
