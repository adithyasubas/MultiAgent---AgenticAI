# Refresh A Balcony Planter For Pollinators

Clean out last season's soil and pests, then add two inches of fresh potting mix with slow-release fertilizer and pre-moisten it so seedlings settle in easily.

Arrange dwarf lavender at the back for height, with lemon thyme, basil, and trailing nasturtiums toward the front and edges. Keep fragrance and bloom windows staggered to feed bees all summer.

Plant at nursery depth, firm the soil, and water until it drains. Maintain the container by watering twice weekly in heat, deadheading flowers, and feeding each month with seaweed tonic.

Enjoy the buzz and share your container using #BalconyBloomClub.
