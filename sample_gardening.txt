Welcome back gardeners. In this video I'm showing you how to refresh a balcony container with pollinator friendly herbs and flowers that stay compact all season.

We start by clearing the old soil, keeping an eye out for any pests hiding in the root ball. I add a two inch layer of fresh potting mix with slow release fertilizer and pre-moisten it so the seedlings don't stress.

Next I arrange dwarf lavender in the back for height, then tuck in lemon thyme, trailing nasturtiums, and a pocket of basil near the front where the sun hits hardest. When you build your layers think about scent and bloom succession to keep bees visiting all summer.

Once the layout looks balanced I plant everything at the same depth they were in their nursery pots, gently firm the soil, and water until it runs from the drainage holes. For care tips: water twice a week in hot weather, clip blooms to encourage more flowers, and feed with a seaweed tonic monthly. That's it, enjoy your balcony buzzing with life.
